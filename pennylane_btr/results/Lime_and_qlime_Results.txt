text sample in this movie, joe pesci slams dunks a basketball. joe pesci...and being consistent, the rest of the script is equally not believable.pesci is a funny guy, which saves this film from sinking int the absolute back of the cellar, but the other roles were pretty bad. the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people, which wasn't even well-played. instead of the man being an archetypal villain, he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs. then there's the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something...i don't even remember...she was that forgettable.anyone who rates this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the reputation of this sunken film, or at least one of those millions of media minions who can't critique efficiently (you know, the people who feel bad if they give anything a mark below 6).stay away...far away. and shame on comedy central, where i saw this film. they usually pick better. bin_features [0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0] vectorizer ['acting' 'bad' 'best' 'don' 'film' 'good' 'great' 'just' 'like' 'movie'

text sample ******warning: may contain spoilers**************so who are these "mystery men?" simply put, the mystery men are a group of sub-heroes desperately trying to live out their adolescent fantasy lives while botching both their real identities and their super identities. the shoveller (bill macy) works construction during the day, and at night, leaves his wife and kids at home while he cruises the street looking for crimes to tackle with his extraordinary and unique shovel-fighting style. the blue raja (hank azaria) sells silverware to newlyweds by day and flings tableware at crackpot villians by night, if his mom isn't keeping him busy with the latest snooping. mr. furious works in a junk yard to earn his pay, then takes out his frustration on his friends at night, tossing ill-conceived one-liners at friend and foe alike and threatening to get really angry (leaving everyone to wonder, so what?). ben stiller breathes such life into this character, you can't help but love him.these three spend their nights trying to capture that 'moment of glory' they've dreamed about... becoming real super heroes. obviously, it could happen. champion city has captain amazing, after all... a flying, fighting super-cop with enough corporate logos on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two. greg kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middle-aged sellout trying to recapture his fans attention in the twilight of his career.to bring back that 'extra magic' that might win the endorsements again, c.a. frees casanova frankenstein, a waaaaay over-the-top menace played to chilling perfection by goeffrey rush. this lunatic genius has created a 'psychofrakulator' to warp champion city into a reflection of his own insanities... and ends up capturing c.a. within hours of his release from prison. this leaves only the mystery men to stop frankenstein's evil plan, but with such henchmen as the disco boys protecting frankenstein, the trio are going to need a little help.recruiting commences, and after a painful recruitment party, the team settles in with the bowler (janeane garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in the team, with her mystic bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father; the invisible boy (kel mitchell), who claims to turn invisible when absolutely no one is looking at him; the spleen (paul reubens), granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy; and the much underused sphinx (wes studi), who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind, then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over-wise.this film really is a cross-genre romp. anyone wanting to pigeon-hole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle. this is a spoof/parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-burton sets recycled endlessly (and occasionally decorated with more spoof material) to the ridiculous costumes, the comic-book genre gets a pretty good send-up. but at the same time, it is a serious superhero flick, as well. both at once. while not a necessarily unique idea in itself (for example, this movie is in some ways reflective of d.c. comic's short-lived inferior five work), it is fairly innovative for the big screen. it offers the comic-book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway, then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know, if superheroes were real, so would these guys be real. if the big guy with the s were flying around new york city, you'd see a half-dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis. sure, the shoveller fights pretty well, and the blue raja hurls forks with great accuracy - all parts of the super-hero world. but does that make them genuine super-heroes? only in their minds.this movie is also a comedy, albeit a dark one. inevitable, when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super-heroics. one-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of. particularly marvelous is the dialogue by janeane garofalo with her bowling ball/father. yet, it isn't a comedy in the sense of side-splitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes. it mixes in a dose of drama, of discovery and of romance, but never really ventures fully into any of it.what really makes mystery men a good film, in the end, is that it is very engaging. the weak/lame good guys are eventually justified and, for one shining moment, really become super-heroes; justice is served; and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism (as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise). if the viewer stops trying to label the film, then the film can be a great romp.of course, no movie is perfect. claire forlani comes off as bored and directionless as mr. furious' love interest, in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience. tom waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor dr. heller, although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone. and the villians are never more than gun-toting lackeys (a point of which is made in the film). the cinematography is choppy and disjointed (such as happens in the average comic book, so it is excusable), the music sometimes overpowers the scenery, and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well.yet, overall, this film is incredible. you probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest.8/10 in my opinion. bin_features [1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1] vectorizer ['acting' 'bad' 'best' 'don' 'film' 'good' 'great' 'just' 'like' 'movie'

text sample my friends and i went into this movie not knowing what to expect, but hoping for the best. when we came out, we were only slightly more informed on what the plot of the movie actually was. though not the worst movie i've ever seen, i definitely do not recommend spending your money to see it in theaters. maybe have a friend rent it for you (it's not even worth the rental cost, either) if you really want to see it.when a movie is so convoluted that you have no idea what's going on until the last five minutes, there's really not much that can be said in its defense. the acting was decent, more than you'd expect to get from this movie, and some of the shots were good, but it was all bogged down by a lame plot and poor script.this movie was actually so bad that as soon as it got out, i went and purchased a ticket to see a good movie just to cleanse my mind. i recommend that all of you just skip the first step and go see a good movie instead. bin_features [1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0] vectorizer ['acting' 'bad' 'best' 'don' 'film' 'good' 'great' 'just' 'like' 'movie'

text sample i love cheesy horror flicks. i don't care if the acting is sub-par or whether the monsters look corny. i liked this movie except for the bewildered feeling all the way from the beginning of the film to the very end. look, i don't need a 10 page dissertation or a sign with big letters explaining a plot to me. but dark floors takes the "what is this movie about?" thing to a whole new (annoying) level. what is this movie about?this isn't exceptionally scary or thrilling but if you have an hour and a half to kill and/or you want to end up feeling frustrated and confused, rent this winner. bin_features [1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1] vectorizer ['acting' 'bad' 'best' 'don' 'film' 'good' 'great' 'just' 'like' 'movie'

text sample a vietnam vet decides to take over a backwater town run amok, and anyone who steps in his path is eliminated (including women). released to theaters just prior to "a star is born", which turned his career around, this action-drama mishmash starring kris kristofferson is wildly off-kilter, thoughtless and mean-spirited. filmed in simi valley, ca, the results are truly unseemly, with redneck clichés and mindless violence making up most of director george armitage's script. armitage has gathered a most curious '70s cast for his film, including jan-michael vincent, victoria principal, bernadette peters, and, in a bit, loni anderson; however, the center of the whole thing is kristofferson, who is gruff and rude throughout. it deserves points i suppose for being a completely unsympathetic drive-in thriller, but the bad vibes (and the ridiculous climax) coat the whole project like an ugly stain. *1/2 from **** bin_features [1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0] vectorizer ['bad' 'don' 'film' 'good' 'great' 'just' 'like' 'make' 'movie' 'people'

text sample the best modesty blaise movie i have seen so far. it's like a good pilot for a tv-series. i even think it's a little bit "cult", like with a lite touch of quentin tarantino's magic, or something. they have caught a great deal of modesty's character, but i admit missing willy garwin a bit. even if i have read many comics and book by peter o'donnell i'm not disappointed of this film, quite the opposite. positive surprised of this story about modesty and her childhood. i did not put my expectations so high, because of the bad movie from 1966. so i may have overrate this movie just a little. but if you like the comics and other storys about modesty blaise, you should definitely see this one! can't wait for a follow-up... bin_features [1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0] vectorizer ['bad' 'don' 'film' 'good' 'great' 'just' 'like' 'make' 'movie' 'people'

text sample steve carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy, first on 'the daily show', and then in various supporting roles. in virgin, carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths. carell plays andy stitzer, a middle aged man living a quiet, lonely life. andy is a little odd, but in an awkward nice guy sort of way. one night, while socializing with his co-workers for the first time, andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. his co-workers, david (paul rudd), jay (romany malco), and cal (seth rogen) initially tease andy about his situation. but it's clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that andy is, and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity. and so begins andy's quest into adulthood. andy is the quintessential innocent, and the bulk of the humor derives from his naiveté to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film. some of the humor is crude gross out stuff, but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy. in addition, i found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life. i'm not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama; it's a rolling in your seats comedy. still, every good comedy i have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters. a good comparison would be 'the wedding crashers' from earlier this summer. virgin has a similar humor, but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes. i particularly loved the ending of the film, which i thought was a perfect way to end the flick. without giving anything away, it reminded me of 'something about mary'. very light and fun; it leaves you laughing and smiling, which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy. i would highly recommend. bin_features [0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1] vectorizer ['bad' 'don' 'film' 'good' 'great' 'just' 'like' 'make' 'movie' 'people'
