The data for the sentiment classifier can be downloaded from: https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
Tests have been conducted on both Iris and the IMDb dataset, using LIME Q-LIME pi. The ML models used on these are NN and QCNN.
An optimization of the models was also conducted with both the NN and the QCNN results from the global explainer I developed. 
The plots can also be found in the code.
